The AE-Lib has the following source Groups:

AE:     
    It contains ae.c implementation. You may change the implementation as long as you keep the interface of functions unchanged. 
    But in general, this one does not need to be changed by students.

AE-public:
    It contains public testing suites released by lab staff.

AE-stu:
    It contains students' testing suites. Each testing suit is in a separate .c file. 
    The naming convention is ae_mem<suite ID>_G<group id>.c.  For example
    ae_mem1_G99.c is the Test Suite 1 from Group 99.
    By default, this source group is excluded from the build.
    
AE-active:
    It contains the active testing suite that you want to use.
    By default it is empty.
    To use a student's test suite .c file, first exclude the AE-public folder from the build.
    Then drag the corresponding student's testing suite file to the AE-active folder.
    
    When students submit, they should leave the AE-active folder empty and include the AE-public folder in the build.
